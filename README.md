# Testing and Debugging MERN Applications

This assignment focuses on implementing comprehensive testing strategies for a MERN stack application, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, along with debugging techniques.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up testing environments for both client and server
2. Write unit tests for React components and server functions
3. Implement integration tests for API endpoints
4. Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
5. Apply debugging techniques for common MERN stack issues

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
3. Follow the setup instructions in the `Week6-Assignment.md` file
4. Explore the starter code and existing tests
5. Complete the tasks outlined in the assignment

## Files Included

- `Week6-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions
- Starter code for a MERN application with basic test setup:
  - Sample React components with test files
  - Express routes with test files
  - Jest and testing library configurations
  - Example tests for reference

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or Atlas account)
- npm or yarn
- Basic understanding of testing concepts

## Testing Tools

- Jest: JavaScript testing framework
- React Testing Library: Testing utilities for React
- Supertest: HTTP assertions for API testing
- Cypress/Playwright: End-to-end testing framework
- MongoDB Memory Server: In-memory MongoDB for testing

## 🧪 How to Run Tests

### 1. Install Dependencies

In the project root, run:
```
npm install
```
Then, install dependencies in both client and server:
```
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install
```

### 2. Unit & Integration Tests

#### Run all tests from the root:
```
npm test
```

#### Run client tests only:
```
cd client
npm test
```

#### Run server tests only:
```
cd server
npm test
```

#### Run with coverage:
```
npm test -- --coverage
```

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests with Cypress

#### Open Cypress UI:
```
cd client
npx cypress open
```

#### Run Cypress tests headlessly:
```
cd client
npx cypress run
```

### 4. Notes
- Make sure your development server is running for E2E tests (e.g., `npm start` in client/server as needed).
- For integration tests, a test database will be used automatically (see `.env.test`).
- Coverage reports will be generated in the `coverage/` directory.

## Submission

Your work will be automatically submitted when you push to your GitHub Classroom repository. Make sure to:

1. Complete all required tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end)
2. Achieve at least 70% code coverage for unit tests
3. Document your testing strategy in the README.md
4. Include screenshots of your test coverage reports
5. Demonstrate debugging techniques in your code
